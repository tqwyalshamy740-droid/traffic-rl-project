🚦 Traffic Signal Control using Reinforcement Learning

A reinforcement learning project for optimizing traffic signal control at a single intersection using a two-stage approach:

- 🟡 Tabular Q-Learning (baseline + behavioral analysis)
- 🔵 Deep Q-Network (DQN) (advanced scalable solution)

The goal is to minimize traffic congestion and average waiting time while maximizing throughput at a single intersection.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Urban traffic congestion leads to increased waiting time, inefficiency, and pollution.  
This project explores how reinforcement learning can dynamically control traffic signals to optimize flow without fixed timing rules.

## 🧠 Approach

### 1️⃣ Q-Learning (Baseline Phase)

Used as an initial approach to understand environment dynamics.

*Key Features:*
- Tabular Q-learning
- Discretized state space
- Epsilon-greedy exploration
- Bellman equation updates
- Policy extraction & visualization

### 2️⃣ Deep Q-Network (DQN) (Advanced Phase)

Designed to handle continuous state space and improve scalability.

*Key Features:*
- Deep neural network approximation
- Experience replay buffer
- Target network updates
- Double DQN stability improvements
- Reward normalization
